                the ram we use these days are called ddr4 ram the meaning of ddr4 <br>
                is Double Data Rate Fourth Generation Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access <br>
                Memory. we use rame to store some kind of programe temporerley <br>
                if we do not have ram it will take a lot of time to do something <br>
                in the programme. <br>

                DDR5 is going to be better than DDR4 in pretty much every different <br>
                aspect. Most notably, DDR5 will have a higher <br>
                bandwidth with reduced latency, all whilst consuming <br>
                less power than DDR4. It will also allow us to have greater RAM <br>
                capacity, and therefore a much more powerful laptop or computer <br>
            </p>

                While DDR4 DIMMs top out at 3.2 gigabits per second (Gbps) at a <br>
                clock rate of 1.6 gigahertz (GHz), initial DDR5 will <br>
                deliver a 50% bandwidth increase to 4.8 Gbps. DDR5 memory <br> 
                will ultimately double the data rate of DDR4 DRAM reaching 6.4 Gbps. <br>

            European researchers have a strong position in a new technology known as <br> 
            resistive RAM (RRAM) that could soon be replacing flash RAM <br>
             in USB drives and other portable gadgets. On the <br>
            'semiconductor road map' setting out the future of <br>
            the microchip industry, current memory technologies <br>
            are nearing the end of the road. <br>

            <h3>what is gddr6</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                the meaning of gddr6 is Graphics Double Data Rate gen 6 <br>
                the gddr6 ram is the memory of a graphics card they  <br>
                much much muchhhhh ! faster than normal ram and that is <br>
                 why gddr6 is so expensive than ram you cannot buy gddr6 <br>
                 like ram modules, and you cant upgrade gddr ram, the normal <br>
                 name of the gddr ram is called vram (video ram) <br>    
            </p>

            <h3>do you realy need ram</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you powered up a computer without RAM, it wouldn't <br>
                move past the POST screen (Power-On Self-Test). ... Several beeps <br>
                coming out of your computer case would accompany it. <br>
                This way, your computer would tell you that it lacks RAM and that <br>
                it can't boot. <br>
            </p>
